# Premier Leagueweb Scraping Tool

Investigates a study based on the Relative Age Effect. A Python script using Selenium was executed for hours to scrape player statistics. The findings and analysis were summarized in a 12-page report. 

## Report Introduction/Background 
The relative age effect (RAE) is a phenomenon where athletes—especially in their youth—appear to perform better than if they were born earlier in the year. Their success is cumulative through the Matthew Effect. The Matthew Effect is the notion that an initial subtle advantage or disadvantage can accumulate to become significant long term. It is proposed that youth athletes born earlier in the year have an advantage over other players in their respective cohort. A ten year old born in January is about 10% older than a ten year old born in December. Since most people experience a growth spurt between ages 8 and 13 due to puberty, an age advantage gives a noticeable athletic advantage.

## Report Objective
The objective of this report is to determine if the RAE is present in the English Premier League, mutually considered the most competitive football league in the world in 2023. It can be achieved through assessing player performances with respect to their birthdate.
